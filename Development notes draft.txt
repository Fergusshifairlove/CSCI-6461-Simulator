This is a draft for develop designs.

Part 1: Basic machine

Since we are working on a basic machine of several parts:

	Basic machine architecture
	Simple Memory
	Load and Store instructions
	User interface

I am here building a simple user interface as a further development skeleton. This interface will show several things: the simulated panel which serves as the 'Machine' panel, another panel with several 'States' of the CPU and memory. 

The design of instructions goes into another file.
